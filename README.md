### Objective

Write automated test cases for an online shop to test the core functionality of the site.

### Tasks

-   Compile a list of several testable user flows, cases, or scenarios. This doesn't have to cover every possible real-life case; please focus on what you think is most fundamental (e.g., sign in).

| Site        | URL                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Online Shop | https://[www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/) |

Make sure to test scenarios for all provided user accounts.

| User                    | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| standard_user           | The site should work as expected for this user                          |
| locked_out_user         | User is locked out and should not be able to log in.                    |
| problem_user            | Images are not loading for this user.                                   |
| performance_glitch_user | This user has high loading times. Does the site still work as expected? |

-   Implement automated browser tests for all flows.
